## Movies

We start by checking how many movies were released each year. We can see that the number increases each year, with the bigger shift happening between 2015 and 2016. After 2018, the number starts to drop, with the biggest decrease between 2020 and 2021. Personally, I would have expected the number of movies to increase during the pandemic, since one could argue that it would have been in Netflix's best interest to take advantage of the fact that people couldn't go to the theaters; nonetheless, it was also much more difficult to produce the movies because of all the protocols that had to be implemented to minimize contagions, so that gives this result more sense.
